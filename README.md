# Kotlin-Bottom-Navigation-Floating-Button
Its a small example of bottom navigation with floating button. I have used material design for the implementation and good UI

Dependency used

```
//    Material Design Dependency:
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.5.0-alpha05'
    
```
NOTE: if using above dependency please make sure your compileSdk from build.gradel file is set to 31, if might face any error. 

# Home Screen

As you can see bottom navigation menu is implemented with floating action button. 

# Fab click  
![alt text](/screenshots/fab_button_click.PNG)

Floating action button is added with Bottom navigation menu and if you click on it a toast will be shown with text "Fab Button Clicked".
