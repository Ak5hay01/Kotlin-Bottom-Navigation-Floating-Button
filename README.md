# Kotlin-Bottom-Navigation-Floating-Button
Its a small example of bottom navigation with floating button. I have used material design for the implementation and good UI


# Home Screen

As you can see bottom navigation menu is implemented with floating action button. 

# Fab click

Floating action button is added with Bottom navigation menu and if you click on it a toast will be shown with text "Fab Button Clicked".
